  Generating the global experiment variable definitions file here:
    GLOBAL_VAR_DEFNS_FP = '/scratch2/NAGAPE/epic/Brian.Weir/expt_dirs/grid_RRFS_CONUS_25km_ics_NAM_lbcs_NAM_suite_GFS_v16/var_defns.yaml'
  For more detailed information, set DEBUG to 'TRUE' in the experiment
  configuration file ('config.yaml').

  Creating rocoto workflow XML file (WFLOW_XML_FP):
    WFLOW_XML_FP = '/scratch2/NAGAPE/epic/Brian.Weir/expt_dirs/grid_RRFS_CONUS_25km_ics_NAM_lbcs_NAM_suite_GFS_v16/FV3LAM_wflow.xml'

  To launch the workflow, change location to the experiment directory
  (EXPTDIR) and issue the rocotrun command, as follows:

    > cd /scratch2/NAGAPE/epic/Brian.Weir/expt_dirs/grid_RRFS_CONUS_25km_ics_NAM_lbcs_NAM_suite_GFS_v16
    > rocotorun -w FV3LAM_wflow.xml -d FV3LAM_wflow.db -v 10

  To check on the status of the workflow, issue the rocotostat command
  (also from the experiment directory):

    > rocotostat -w FV3LAM_wflow.xml -d FV3LAM_wflow.db -v 10

  Note that:

  1) The rocotorun command must be issued after the completion of each
     task in the workflow in order for the workflow to submit the next
     task(s) to the queue.

  2) In order for the output of the rocotostat command to be up-to-date,
     the rocotorun command must be issued immediately before issuing the
     rocotostat command.

  For automatic resubmission of the workflow (say every 3 minutes), the
  following line can be added to the user's crontab (use 'crontab -e' to
  edit the cron table):

  */3 * * * * cd /scratch2/NAGAPE/epic/Brian.Weir/expt_dirs/grid_RRFS_CONUS_25km_ics_NAM_lbcs_NAM_suite_GFS_v16 && ./launch_FV3LAM_wflow.sh called_from_cron="TRUE"
